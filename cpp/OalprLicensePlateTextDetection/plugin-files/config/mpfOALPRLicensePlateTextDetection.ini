# Set the name of the OpenALPR config file
OPENALPR_CONFIG_FILE: openalpr.conf

# Set the value of the TESSDATA_PREFIX environment variable
# OpenALPR requires that that the environment variable TESSDATA_PREFIX be set to
# the parent directory of the "tessdata" directory.
# NOTE: This is only a default value.  Normally, the correct value is set in the
# environment before the text detection component is run.  This value will only
# be used if the environment variable is not already set.
TESSDATA_PREFIX: /usr/share/openalpr/runtime_data/ocr

# Set the OpenALPR country code (either "us" to look for USA
# license plates or "eu" to look for European plates)
OPENALPR_COUNTRY_CODE: us

# Set the maximum integer number of possible plate numbers for
# OpenALPR to return - even though we only look at the highest
# confidence result, setting this value to a value greater 
# than 1 tends to yield higher quality results
OPENALPR_TOP_N: 10

# Set the minimum amount of license plate area overlap from frame 
# to frame that should be used to associate a license plate detection
# with an existing license plate track
RECTANGLE_INTERSECTION_MIN: 0.75

# Set the minimum string similarity value that should be used
# to associate detected text with an existing track, given that
# OpenALPR does not always detect text with 100% accuracy, where
# a value of 1.0 means that two text strings must be identical
