# DO_EDGE = 0: No edge detection.
# DO_EDGE = 1: Enable edge detection on adjacent frames.
# Runs a sobel filter on the current frame, then compares results from the previous frame.
# Frames with a high mismatch in edge pixels will be detected as a scene change.
DO_EDGE: 1

# DO_HIST = 0: No histogram detection.
# DO_HIST = 1: Enable histogram detection on adjacent frames.
# Compares adjacent frames using histogram representations (computes correlation between the two image histograms).
# Frames that match poorly (low correlation) will be detected as a scene change.
DO_HIST: 1

# DO_CONT = 0: No content detection.
# DO_CONT = 1: Enable content detection on adjacent frames.
# Compares differences between adjacent frames based on HSV pixel values.
# Differences in hue, saturation, and value are averaged together.
# Frames with a high mismatch score will be detected as a scene change.
DO_CONT: 1

# DO_THRS = 0: No threshold detection.
# DO_THRS = 1: Enable threshold detection on a single frame.
# Checks if a majority (set by user) of an image falls below a certain brightness (set by user).
# If so, the scene will be detected as a fade out.
DO_THRS: 1


# USE_MIDDLE_FRAME = 0: Store all frames in each scene.
# USE_MIDDLE_FRAME = 1: Store middle frame of each scene.
# By default store the middle frame of each scene as the overall representation
# of that scene. Disable to store MPFImageLocation of all scene frames.
USE_MIDDLE_FRAME: 1

# (double) - Sets threshold for edge detection (range 0-255).
# Fepresents cutoff score for fraction of mismatches between two frames.
# Higher thresholds = less frame detections = lower sensitivity.
EDGE_THRESHOLD: 70

# (double) - Sets threshold for hist detection (range 0-1).
# Represents cutoff score for hist correlation between two frames.
# Higher thresholds = more frame detections = higher sensitivity.
HIST_THRESHOLD: 0.90

# (double) - Sets threshold for content detection (range 0-255).
# Represents cutoff score for fraction of mismatch between two frames.
# Higher threshold = less frame detections.
CONT_THRESHOLD: 35

# (double) - Sets threshold for threshold detection (range 0-255).
# Represents cutoff score for pixel color values of a single image.
# Higher threshold = more pixel detections.
# NOTE: User will also need to set MIN_PERCENT.
# Threshold range is dependent on image format. For 32-bit (jpeg) images, range of acceptable values is 0-255.
THRS_THRESHOLD: 15.0

# (double) - Sets min percent of image that must fall below THRS_THRESHOLD (range 0-1).
# Images that satisfy this will be labled as a scene fade out.
# Higher threshold = lower sensitivity.
MIN_PERCENT: 0.95

# (int) - Sets min length (in frames) required for a single scene.
# Any scene changes occurring within the minimum range are ignored.
# Negative values are equivalent to setting min length of 0.
