If this algorithm is used in the first pipeline stage then this property has no effect. Instead, the default segmenting behavior is used, where tracks from the previous stage are used to generate segments based on the TARGET_SEGMENT_LENGTH and MIN_SEGMENT_LENGTH properties. Can be set to “NONE”, “FRAME”, or “SUPERSET_REGION”. If set to “NONE”, the default segmenting behavior is used. If set to “FRAME” or “SUPERSET_REGION”, then the segment length properties are ignored and instead this algorithm will process one segment per track generated in the previous stage. If set to “FRAME”, then this algorithm will ignore the regions associated with previous detections and instead process the entire frame associated with each of those detections. If set to “SUPERSET_REGION”, then this algorithm will generate a superset region for each of the previous tracks – a bounding box of constant size and position that encloses all of the track’s detection regions. This algorithm will only process the data within the superset region.",

If this property is set to “1” then only the exemplar frame for each of the previous tracks is processed. If this property is set to a value > 1, say 5, then each of the detections in the previous track are sorted by confidence and this algorithm will only process the frames associated with the top 5 detections with the highest confidence. For detections with the same confidence values, it will select those with a lower frame index. If the track contains less than 5 detections, then all of the available detections are used.
