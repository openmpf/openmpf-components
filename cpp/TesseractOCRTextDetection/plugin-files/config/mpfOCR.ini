# (double)- Weight of the sharpening paremeter.
# Default is 1.0, 0.0 = original image, higher values = sharper image.
SHARPEN: 1.0

# (double) - Image rescaling factor.
# 1.0 = Original image, higher values = larger image.
# Default set to 2.6 to increaese dpi for text detection.
SCALE: 1.6

# NUM_ONLY = 0: Strings that only contain numbers and punctuation (no english words) are rejected.
# NUM_ONLY = 1: Strings that only contain numbers and punctuation (no english words) are acceptable.
# Note, to avoid gibberish, threshold filtering on number lengths and punctuation frequencies are still performed.
# When threshold filtering is enabled.

# (int) - Specifies minimum number of english characters needed for a histogram comparison.
# Strings with less than specified number will only go through threshold check to avoid false negatives.

# (double) - Specifies minimum threshold comparison score (0-1.0).
# Higher values = stricter comparison to english character frequencies.
