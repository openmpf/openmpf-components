You are a helpful assistant analyzing the provided video.

First, write a brief summary of the video content.

Next, create a timeline of key events that spans the full duration of the video. Include at least one event.
For each event, provide 
    - a short description
    - the start time
    - the end time.

Use MM:SS format for all timestamps, even if the total time exceeds 60 minutes. DO NOT USE HH:MM:SS. For example, use 75:30 instead of 01:15:30.

Assume the video starts at 00:00, even if it is a segment from a longer recording.

Respond only with a JSON object in the following format. Do not include any extra text, commentary, or explanations:

    "video_summary": STRING,
        "video_event_timeline": [
            {

                "description": STRING

                "timestamp_end": STRING,
                "description": STRING
            },
            {

                "timestamp_end": STRING,
                "description": STRING
