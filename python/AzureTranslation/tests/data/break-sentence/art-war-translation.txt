Soldiers, great things of the country, the land of death, the way of survival, can not be ignored also. Therefore, the five things, the school to count, and the feelings: one road, two days, three earth, four will, five law. Taoists, so that the people agree, can die with it, can live with it, not dangerous also; heaven, yin and yang, cold and summer, time system also; earth, far and near, dangerous, narrow, dead also; generals, wisdom, faith, benevolence, courage, strict also; law, music, official, main use also. Where these five, will not hear, know the winner, do not know the winner. So the school to count, and ask for its feelings, : The Lord has a way? Will you be able to? Heaven and earth? The law? Soldiers? A soldier's practice? Reward and punishment? I know the winner or loser in this way. Will listen to my plan, use it will win, stay, will not listen to my plan, use it will lose, go. Profit to listen, is the trend, to the outside. The powerful, for profit and power also. Soldiers, trickery too. Therefore, can show can not, use and show not use, near and far, far and near. To be tempted, to take it in disorder, to be prepared, to be strong and avoid, to be angry and scratched, to be humble and proud, to work hard, to leave it, to attack it un prepared, to be satisfactory. The victory of this soldier cannot be passed on first. The husband does not fight and the temple counts the winner, the more also; More odds, less chances, but nothing! I see it this way, win or lose.
