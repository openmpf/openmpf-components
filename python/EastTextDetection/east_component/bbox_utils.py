    """ An approximate locality-aware variant of non-maximum suppression, which
        merges together overlapping boxes rather than suppressing them.

        Non-maximum suppression (NMS) selects regions in order of decreasing
        confidence and discards all lower-confidence regions whose intersection
        over union with the current region is greater than some threshold value.
        This has the effect of pruning overlapping boxes from the set of
        detections, retaining only those with the highest confidence scores.

        Locality-Aware NMS (LANMS), proposed by Zhou et al. in EAST: An
        Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector, performs an initial linear
        time row-merging pass which significantly reduces the number of
        detections before performing the standard quadratic time NMS procedure.
        In the row-merging pass, adjacent overlapping regions are combined via a
        confidence-weighted average of their geometries. This is done
        iteratively, so the combined region is then compared with the next
        adjacent detection.

        We make several key changes to the LANMS algorithm.
        1. The initial row-merging pass is not iterative: we
           instead take "runs" of overlapping bounding boxes (essentially
           connected components in the flattened grid) and merge them together.
           This allows for a significant speedup through NumPy vectorization.
        2. In the standard LANMS scheme, "merging" means to take the
           score-weighted average of bounding box corner coordinates. In our
           algorithm, we replace overlapping regions with a minimal oriented
           bounding box which encloses the set of regions to be merged, whose
           rotation is defined as the score-weighted average of the constituent
           bounding box orientations.
        3. Even after the locality-aware first pass, we merge boxes rather than
           suppress the ones with lower confidence. As above, the orientation
           of the merged box is a confidence-weighted average.
        4. We threshold not the intersect over union, but the intersect over
           smallest area. This is because, as merged regions grow larger, the
           IoU between them and smaller boxes will shrink. Because the
           threshold value is constant, large boxes will eventually never merge
           with smaller boxes.
        5. In addition to thresholding the overlap, we theshold the similarity
           between regions in rotation and text height. This way, text with very
           dissimilar orientations or scales will not be combined. The text
           height at the first pass is defined as the height of the bounding
           box. When merged, the merged region's text height is the
           confidence-weighted average of the text heights of the constituent
           boxes (so a large region composed of many small boxes will still be
           associated with small text).

        Note: During merging, the confidence "weight" of a merged box is the sum
           of the constituent confidences. This is to prevent a small box
           significantly altering the properties of a large merged region
           containing many constituent boxes. However, the reported confidence
           of a merged region is the maximum of its constituent scores.
