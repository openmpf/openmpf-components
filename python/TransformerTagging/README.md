# Overview

This repository contains source code for the OpenMPF Transformer Tagging component.

This component uses a user-specified corpus-json file to match known phrases against 
each sentence in the input text data. This is done by generating an embedding for each 
phrase in the corpus and comparing that against the embedding for each sentence of the 
input text. The comparison generates a score based on how similar the content is. 
This is based on how the underlying
[all-mpnet-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2) 
was trained on a variety of text data in order to understand the common phrasing, 
subject, and context. The sentences that generate scores above the threshold are 
called "trigger sentences". These sentences are grouped by "tag" based on which entry 
in the corpus they matched against.

This component can be used independently to perform transformer tagging on text
files, or it can be used as a support component in a multi-stage pipeline to
perform transformer tagging on feed-forward detections generated by some other
component.

# Inputs

The transformer tagger will run on all input properties listed in the 
`FEED_FORWARD_PROP_TO_PROCESS`. If there are feed-forward detections generated from 
an upstream component in a multi-stage pipeline, the output properties from that 
component are preserved. This means that if those detections have a `TEXT` output 
property, this component will generate detections with the same `TEXT` output. 
Similarly, if those detections have a `TRANSLATION` output property, then this 
component will generate detections with the same `TRANSLATION` output. If none of the 
input properties are present then the transformer tagging is not performed then the 
feed-forward detection is returned unmodified.

The reported detections that are returned by the transformer tagger are based on the 
corpus used, and the minimum score defined in the`SCORE_THRESHOLD` property. These 
values are discussed below. 

# Corpus File

Transformer patterns are specified in a JSON corpus file. By default this is the 
`transformer_text_tags_corpus.json` file. Alternativley, the path to a corpus file can 
be changed by setting the `TRANSFORMER_TAGGING_CORPUS` property.

In the corpus file, users can specify sentence patterns to compare against using the 
following syntax:

```
    [
    {
        "text": "This sentence is dog.",
        "tag": "dog"
    }
    ]
```

Where the `text` field specifies a sentence to compare against, and the `tag` field 
is used to report in the output results if the input sentence scores meet the 
`SCORE_THRESHOLD`.

Multiple patterns can be specified with a comma separated list:

```
    [
    {
        "text": "This sentence is dog.",
        "tag": "dog"
    },
    {
        "text": "My favorite animal is a corgi.",
        "tag": "dog"
    },
    {
        "text": "This sentence is cat.",
        "tag": "cat"
    },
    ...
    ]
```

# Outputs

When performing transformer tagging on a text file, the contents of the file will be
stored in a `TEXT` output property. Text input that is not just whitespace, which has 
sentences that scored high enough against entries in the corpus file, will result in 
the following output properties: 

- `TEXT [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES`
- `TEXT [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES OFFSET`
- `TEXT [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES SCORE`
- `TRANSLATION [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES`
- `TRANSLATION [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES OFFSET`
- `TRANSLATION [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES SCORE`
Note: The '[TAG]' value in each of the output properties above will be the tag 
property from the corpus file that the trigger sentence scored against.

The tags associated with the trigger words will be stored in a `TAGS` output 
property, separated by semicolons. Note that there is only one `TAGS` output 
property. This is unlike `TEXT [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES` and `TEXT [TAG] TRIGGER 
SENTENCES OFFSET`, which are prefixed by the input property that produced those 
trigger words. Each tag will only appear once in `TAGS` no matter how many trigger 
words activate that tag. It doesn't matter if the trigger words are found in only one
or multiple input properties defined in `FEED_FORWARD_PROP_TO_PROCESS`.

When `ENABLE_DEBUG` is set to true, the output properties will include a 
`TRIGGER SENTENCES MATCHES` property containing a semicolon separated list of the 
`text` sentences in the corpus that were triggered for that tag.

- `TEXT [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES`
- `TEXT [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES MATCHES`
- `TEXT [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES OFFSET`
- `TEXT [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES SCORE`
- `TRANSLATION [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES`
- `TRANSLATION [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES MATCHES`
- `TRANSLATION [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES OFFSET`
- `TRANSLATION [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES SCORE`

Let's assume that we need process the `TEXT` property. The sentence(s) that
triggered each tag will be stored in `TEXT [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES`. While the
sentence that was matched against in the corpus will be stored in the
`TEXT [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES MATCHES` property. For each trigger sentence the 
substring index range relative to the `TEXT` output will be stored in 
`TEXT [TAG] TRIGGER SENTENCES OFFSET`.
