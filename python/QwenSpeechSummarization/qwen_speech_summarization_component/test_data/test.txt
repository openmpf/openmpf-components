Mr. J. J. TRoy,
2774 Eighth Avenue,
New York City.

DEAR Troy:

‘Mighty glad to get your letter, and am pleased to
learn of the new venture, which I hope will pay you
well. Ili any one is qualified for getting out such a book
to teach the young fellows, you surely are well equipped
from your long and active experience and then being
in such close touch with the game ever since leaving the
big league.

I don’t publish anything myself or have anything to
sell, hence I have nothing to arrange for in the matter
of advertising space in your book. |

When your book is published send a bundle of books
over and I will present them to some of the “future
greats.”

I would be glad to have you attend our meetings here
any time, and will fix you up with a good seat any time
you can run over.

With personal regards and best wishes,

Cordially yours,
W. A. SUNDAY.

BY JOHN (DASHER) TROY
One Time Major League Ball Player

There. was a day when John (Dasher) Troy was one of
the bright lights of the diamond. Advancing age has long
since driven him from his favorite haunts. But, though, as_
he admits, he has “had his day and that day is a long time
past,’ still he has “seen more baseball games than any
othe player in the country,’ and remained throughout a
close student and observer of the game. His observations
in the form of little lessons to ambitious ball players, and
illuminating side discourse to the public on inside baseball,
form a series of unusual interest.

REMINISCENCES OF AN OLD TIMER

Suggestions to Would-be Ball Players—The Game in
«the Old Days—Hints on-Inside Baseball.

ASEBALL is a sport that people will never grow
B tired reading about. I suppose that even the
old -ball player, if he should start to tell them
--something about the game of his day, might in-
terest them. At least I am going to make the effort, for
I am an old ball player, who could once round the bases
as fast as the best of them, and though I have had my
day and it has passed a good while ago, I am still as
closely bound to the diamond by interest as I was in”
my younger days when I was.a pl ball player
myself. = é
My Sijecr in présicne into print at my time of oe
isn't only to interest the public. I know that their
interest has made baseball great. But while I realize
and appreciate what the public have done, and it has
been a great work in baseball, my more immediate object
is to. give some few facts from my own experience
and some lessons gleaned from my many years’ obser-
vation of baseball since I ceased to be a player myself,
which might perhaps be of some value as friendly advice
A |

and instruction to the young player who stands to-day
where I stood nearly forty years ago.

Perhaps the public may find some interest, too, in
these few scattered lessons, as they are curious about
what they call inside baseball, a term that has been
coined of late years, though we of the old school used
to practice what we may have known by a different
name or never called by name at all. For the lessons
which a young ball player must learn are, after all,
only inside baseball of the most direct and, therefore,
the most valuable kind.

I cannot go on without a word of the old days when
I was young and in the ranks. I see in my memory those
ola stars, remember how they used to play the game,
the hardships they endured, and the scant recognition:
they ever received for their services. They are all gone
now. But those old-timers, whatever their worth, made
baseball. They had to contend with conditions that
the young player of to-day knows nothing about. The
game was a precarious proposition in those days,
and the salary list had no resemblance to that of the
present. It was downright hard work, with all the
dangers of the present game magnified tenfold and.
little of the comforts of the present to offset the great
hardships. And so I think it is not too much for me
to claim for the old ball players a high place among
the makers of baseball. They were hard working and
honest, and the debt that baseball owes them for their
service when the game-was not yet established on its
present important pier: will perhaps never be appre-
ciated in full.

_I have often wondered why it 1s that some of the
oldtime ball players, who were stars in their day, have
never taken it upon themselves to. tell the public and
the ball players of the present what kind of a game

was played in those days. They owe it to the old days
to down the impression that the public seems to have that
the game is so far advanced, particularly in pitching,
that the old game could not come anywhere near it.
This is a mistake, which I will maintain as long as I
live, for I have seen both the modern and the oldtime
game, and [ know of my own experience how im-
portant and valuable that old type of baseball actually
was.

There is a great distinction in my mind between base-
ball that is reasonably good, and what I would call
Major League baseball. My object is to try to teach
the young player something of Major League baseball,
for I too, well realize that the manager has no time
and often no inclination to do this. He is too much
occupied with looking out for his own position, and
goes on the theory that the player ought to get his
experience and knowledge himself. So he will not usu-
ally bother with a young fellow, no matter how bright
or skillful he may be, unless he also knows the game
pretty thoroughly as well. To my mind, many a young
fellow with the makings of a star has failed on that
very account, grown discouraged at the difficulty in
his way, and gone into some other profession.

I played baseball for many years, finally retiring
from the active game when the present Polo Grounds
opened up as the Brotherhood Baseball Park. Even
then I went into business in the near neighborhood and
also for many years had the bar and lunch privilege at
the Polo Grounds.

My peculiar position, I believe, has enabled me to
see more baseball games than any other player in the
country. And all that time I need not say I have been
from habit and choice always a close observer —
student of the game. .

6

My first piece of advice to young fellows who are
dreaming of becoming good ball players is this: If
you have good eyesight, get into the game; if not, stay
out, for you will never make a good ball player with
that handicap. Eyesight isn’t often spoken of among
the talents of the ball player, but it is the first and
most important thing.

Along with excellent eyesight should go a good, quick
and clear brain. Education is undoubtedly desirable,
but it is not essential. I never had a very good edu-
‘cation myself, and there are many star ball players,
both of the old days and the present time, who could
not claim to be educated men in the present acceptance
of the term. But whatever his education or lack of
education, baseball requires a man-who is keen-witted
and intelligent. And it demands of him that he keep
his brain well conditioned and do nothing which shall
impair his capacity to quickly grasp lessons which fall
under his observation and apply those lessons. That
type of mind which is not only quick and active, but is
original, always trying something startling and new,
is the highest type of baseball brain. I will have much
more to say of this type, together with certain sug-
gestions which I think should stimulate the student of
the game to better effort. This in brief is the bedrock
of eligibility to the game, for circumstances act just
like a coach at college and training school in picking
out the men who are best fitted for the school teams.
A ball player may not have any coach to contend with,
but he may be sure that circumstances will act in the
long run with greater severity and strict justice than
any coach could give. Whether or not he is fitted to
become a ball player will stand out clearly by his own
qualifications, and the first two are, as I have indicated,
excellent eyesight anda clear, thinking. brain. Later I
7

shall take up more physical qualifications and indicate
how these qualifications apply not only to a ball player
as such, but particularly to the individual positions on
the diamond. |

Several other qualifications are necessary for the
player at any position. Speed is the watchword of
modern baseball. A young athlete must be quick and
active and I would specially recommend all would-be
players to practice the sprint with a good deal of per-
sistence. In track athletics various types of foot races
are in order, and they all require an entirely different
training. For instance, the mile runner would very
likely be of no possible good at the hundred yards dis-
tance, just as the hundred yard man would be out of
it at the mile. Baseball is a game of sprints. All the
distances are short, but the man who can get to first
a foot ahead of the other fellow has made a safe hit.

A would-be player must also develop his throwing
atm. To bé a success he must be a fast, acentare
thrower. He should cultivate the overhand throw and
learn to drive the ball on a line. Practice is the most
important way of becoming expert. OS ie eae

Some players are star first basemen, who would be
lost at shortstop for instance. There are certain quali-
fications which go with every position on the diamond.
A player should study his qualifications very carefully,
and try to determine not necessarily the position he
would best like to play, but the position for which he
is best fitted. Many players, even in the Major Leagues,
have lost years of time trying to play a position for
which they were not naturally fitted and have found
out perhaps late in their career the place which they
should have oécupied from the first. I have no hesita-
tion in saying that choice of position is one of the most
important, if not the most important, things for a player

‘ | ?

to decide upon. Upon the wisdom of his choice here
depends a great deal of his future success. 3

The importance of settling this question rightly is
shown by the training necessary in developing a throw-
ing arm. For instance, if a player has decided that he
should play the outfield, he will need to develop his
throwing arm along entirely different lines than would
be the case if he were a shortstop. For instance, an
outfielder will need to develop distance as well as ac-
curacy in his throw. Perhaps the most important part
of an outfielder’s duties is getting a runner at the plate.
Great throwing arms are not common, but there is no
department of an outfielder’s work where they are more
needed.

Conversely, if a player had decided that he was a
natural shortstop he would need to develop a very quick
get-away with the ball and a fairly long throw. Speed
would be in that case the prime essential and, of
course, accuracy as well. But the shortstop would need
to practice a throw from a difficult position as well as
from a natural position, as he often has to make the
throw under very unfavorable circumstances in a sFeU
lation game.

[ have often thought outfielders injured their arms by
a false method of throwing, as it is absolutely certain
pitchers.and catchers often do. If an outfielder will
throw overhand, let his arm out at full length, and
keep his arm close to his ear in throwing, I doubt if
he will ever throw his arm out or injure it in any way.
He will certainly not do so if he has had proper pre-
liminary training and is in good physical condition.

So much for general requirements in a player. To
carry the study further it will be necessary to consider
the various positions in turn. First, because it is one
of the most important and most imperfectly understood.
1 will begin with the position of catcher. |

9

The backstop should be at least five feet, nine inches
in height. Ordinarily the catcher is rather stocky of
build. _ In fact, this type is so well understood that
catchers are usually men of wide muscular development
and of late years what from this and perhaps other
causes catchers have slowed up a good deal in speed so
that they are scarcely better base runners than average
pitchers. There is something in this theory of a stocky
build, as the catcher, like the pitcher, needs to be a man
of good muscular build to stand the constant strain of
his position.

A catcher more than any other player on the diamond,
needs to have a good working knowledge of human
nature. He needs to be the type of man who can humor
the pitcher and, at the same time, jolly the opposing
batter. In a real game, if you sit near enough to home
plate to hear, you will remark that the catcher is usually
‘keeping up a steady stream of comment usually to the
batter. This is done with the well understood intention
of diverting his attention from the matter in hand,
trying, if possible, to get him to take his eye off the
ball for a minute and thus get him in bad with the
‘pitcher. His conversation is much more important than
is commonly understood. In fact, some catchers con-
sider it the most important of qualifications for the job.
‘Street, one of the greatest of American League backstops
in his day, was known as “Gabby,” while Kling, who
was equally great in the National League, had the nick-
name “Noisy,” showing the importance these two per-
formers attached to conversation on the diamond.

This point, I believe, is not generally understood, and
yet it is a fact that one of the prime essentials in a
catcher is to keep his own pitcher encouraged at all
time and rattle the opposing batter if possible. 3

The chief difference between an es catcher

10

and one who isn’t experienced, is in their knowledge
of the game. It is for this reason that a manager very
often keeps an old catcher who is slowed up and can
no longer hit as his first-string man, in preference even
to some brilliant young performer, because the veteran
has long experience and a sound judgment which the
young man lacks. Of course this knowledge can only
be gained by years of work, and that is the very thing
which the young man breaking into the game does not
possess. I mention it because that is the end he should
work for from the time he catches his first game.

The catching talent which shows up most clearly 1s
ability to line a ball down to second base. Not every
one has it in him to be a Jimmy Archer in this respect,
but it is absolutely necessary that a catcher should be
a fast and accurate thrower. Young catchers should
always try to be in a position when they receive a ball
to get the runner trying to steal a base. Whether the
pitched ball is coming above or below the waist, the
catcher should always put his left foot forward; let
his arm go well back, and throw the ball with the same
motion by which he throws his body forward. Never |
draw the arm up in front, and never take a step after
you catch the ball. This is what loses time, and the
smallest fraction of a second is what counts. The in-
stant you have your hand on the ball, throw it with
an overhand motion and on a line. If you do this, you
are bound to throw it accurately. If the ball happens
to be pitched as high as the shoulder, or near it, let
the hand go back over the shoulder and throw the ball
with the full length of the arm. If the ball is pitched on
the inside of the plate and low, stay in your position,
as you may have to take a short step when you throw it.
This seldoms happens, as the pitchers always try. to
help the-catcher get the base runner.

11

_In throwing a ball, always be careful to get a free,
natural motion—never snap the arm; for if you do,
you will be likely to injure the tendons in the shoulder.

Above all, a catcher should have confidence in his
throw. It is hard for the average player to see what
difference this makes, but it does make all the difference
in the world. If the catcher really believes he is going
to. get.the runner, in. «most cases he will - ir Ge issue
doubt about it when he throws, the ball is very apt to go
wide or be too late. Confidence counts everywhere in
baseball, but nowhere more so than with the catcher.

PITCHERS.

The pitcher ought to be tall. If you will look over
the list of Major League pitchers you will find that -
almost all of them are six feet or over. Occasionally a
man much shorter than this becomes a star, but ordin-
arily a good pitcher does not. fail much below six feet
in-height. There is a reason for this. Inthe first place:
a tall-man, since he is usually well-proportioned to be
a bali player, is a big man as well. . Pitching is the
most wearing work in baseball—it requires a man of
more than average endurance and strength. Most man-
agers insist upon having big men for pitchers, and are
not generally interested in small men, even though they
show much cleverness. They figure that a pitcher has”
to be big and strong to stand the strain. Again, a tall
man can get a much better swing with the ball than a
short man, and other things being equal, will have more
speed. The theory that-ball players should be big men

physically has been exploded in reference to some posi-

tions, but still applies to pitchers. The first thing the
pitchers must have, and generally the hardest thing for
him to get, is control. Some pitchers are spitball pitchers, |
and use little else. But the average pitcher employes both

fast balls and curves. A young pitcher must practice both
types until he can be sure of getting the ball over the
plate. In practicing he should always try to put the
ball over the plate, and in time he will get the knack
of doing this. Once he gains control the rest is easy.

Pitching curve balls a foot outside the plate is only
wasting them and gets a pitcher in a hole. Try and
curve them as near the plate as you can. Get control of
them as well as the ball you curve over the plate,
and you may draw the batter on to strike at them or
hit the ball to the first or second baseman.

There is some difference of opinion on pitching de-
livery, but to my mind the pitcher should always keep his
arm as high as he possibly can, especially throwing low
curve balls over the plate. If he can master this art he is
bound to be effective. The pitcher should always watch
the batter and notice the position in which he stands at
the plate. All batters at times step back from the plate
with their left foot. This is a sure sign of lack of confi-
dence and generally denotes that the batter is in a slump.
Such a batter should never get a ball on the inside of the
plate. For that is the only kind of a ball he can hit
good and hard. Otherwise he cannot hit the ball out-
side of the diamond unless it is a scratch hit, for he
has-to over-reach himself to get it, and is not in a
position to hit it hard.

I remember one season, I think it was in 793, Boston
and New York were great rivals, and every game they
played, the grounds in both Boston and the Polo
Grounds, were packed with people. It was late in the
season, and they were tied in the series. The game
was at the Polo Grounds, and there were more than
20,000 spectators. I then had the bar and lunch privi-
lege at the grounds, and some of my friends were
backing Boston to win. So I took the old Giants on

72
iv

general principles. There were a lot of my friends there
that day trying to show me, so they said, how much
I knew about the game. So I thought I would take a
look at my friend; Amos Rusie, who was pitching for
the Giants. He never had more speed, and his inshoot
was working fine on the inside corner of the plate.
Amos was always happy when he had control of that
ball. He was a big, good-natured fellow and did not
want to injure any player. The Boston Club was hitting
the ball hard, and New York was playing a great field-
ing game, making double plays and great stops for the
first two innings. The nine men batted all around, and
Boston succeeded in scoring one run. I sent one of my
workmen down to Amos on the player’s bench with a
note. In this note J told him not to pitch his inshoot, that
nearly every one of the Boston Club was pulling his left
foot back from the plate, and that the batter could not hit
a ball out of the diamond if he would put them low and
over the plate. Hugh Duffy was the first man up for
the next inning, and he hit a slow grounder to the first
baseman; the second batter hitting to the second base-
man, and the third to the first baseman. When Amos
was walking to the bench he looked up toward the bar
on the grandstand, which was behind the catcher at
the back of the stand, and he had a big broad smile on
his face. Any player who pulled his left foot back, or
left-hander, who pulled his right foot back, never hit
Amos very hard after that, and the Giants won the
game, 4-1. A couple of nights afterward I dropped
into a place and met Dad Clarke with a few of his

friends. Dad could give a man quite a tongue-lashing, oe

if he stood for it, and when he saw me he was ripe for

an argument on the old game. He began by saying to

me: “You oldtimers make me sick.” But Dad stepped

on “the tail of my coat when he spoke of oldtimers, for
14

I am always ready to give an argument in their favor.
Dad had been sitting on the bench most of the season,
so I told him about batters stepping back from the
plate. Amos nearly always pitched the first game of
the series against each club. He was a very speedy
pitcher, and if he lost control of his inshoot and hit a
batter it would hurt, which made some of the good
hitters very timid and caused them to step back from
the plate. It would take a few days before they would

get their stride again. J told Dad about this, and told
- him to ask Johnny Ward to let him pitch a game right
after Rusie; and if he won it to ask to be allowed to pitch
every game after Rusie. Ward allowed him the privilege,
and he won the game. He followed it uJ and he won
every game he pitched on the western trip, as he was a
foxy pitcher and told no one the secret of his success. The
batters often wondered why it was that dad was so
successful. They claimed that he had nothing on the
ball. It is true he had a little speed, but because he fol-
lowed the advice I gave him, they could not seem to hit it
out of the infield.

All good pitchers in the old days would try to watch
the position the batter took when he went to the plate,
and pitch accordingly. Pitchers ought to do the same
to-day. The pitcher must always remember that he is
not working by himself alone. To get the best results
he must always co-operate with his catcher. Among
other things he must try to keep the base-runner as
close to the bases as possible, and must be ready to
throw to the base whenever necessary.

_In pitching to the batter, try to put the first ball over

the plate. Most batters don’t hit at the first one, and

if you can get one strike on them without much trouble,

that gives you a big percentage. It is hardly necessary

to say that you must study the batter you face. Try
ae :

to pick out his weakness and always keep this particular
weakness in your head when you are in the box. When
there are men on the bases and a good batter up and
you can see that he is anxious to hit the ball, that is a fine
time to give him a slow ball about knee high and over
the plate. Nine times out of ten he will swing before
the ball gets to him. A pitcher can read a great deal
from the attitude of the various batters who face him
and take advantage of them very often if he is skillful.

The first baseman should be tall. Above all things
he needs a long reach. This position is a good one for
a left handed man, for he does not have to turn in
making the throw to second base. He can also touch
the man coming to first base better, as he will have a
grip on the ball, for he has no glove on his left hand.
A good big fellow who can hit the ball ought to play
this base. He must learn to get all the balls thrown
on a short bound just the same as if they were hit at
him.

The second baseman hae to be at least five feet, ten
inches, a very active fellow who can cover. lots of
ground: He must learn to stop quick, for he has a
large territory to work in—both on fly balls and groun-
ders. In the case of a grounder he should always try to
get in front of the ball so that if he fumbles he can
recover the ball quickly. The second baseman ought
to cover first more often than he does.. When the
bases are empty nearly all those slow hits the first base-
man gets when the pitcher covers the bag ought to go
rather to the second baseman. He should cover the bag
when he can save the pitcher who is by all odds the
hardest worked man on the field. The second baseman
has to be a good under-hand thrower in handling low
thrown balls where he has to make a quick double play.
He also has to have grit and not be afraid of the base

runner.
16

The shertstop is a very hard poistion to play. He
must have an excellent arm and be, a good thrower.
He usually plays a deep field and gets very little help
from the third baseman. On balls which go to the
right of him he has to field clean and throw them very
hard to get the batter. On hits toward second base he
generally has to turn to throw the man out at first, and
consequently must get speed on the throw. He has
to run in on all those little slow hits that look so easy and
not fumble them. He should not snap the ball in run-
ing, as that is how most ball players hurt their arms.
It is always better to stop quick and throw the ball
hard. Pull the arm back, put the left foot forward at
the same lime, and the ball will travel faster and more
accurately. The shortstop often has to ‘cover second
base, particularly in double plays. Shortstop is a very
hard position to play because the third baseman has to
play in short for bunts. He cannot cover ground to
the left of him, and it looks foolish, for he very seldom
throws the batter out on a short hit. It is generally the
pitcher that gets the hit and throws the batter out. The
only batters they really get are the men that hit an
ordinary slow hit, and the third baseman could handle
these just as, well if he would play a deeper field and
tin in on the ball. What a pleasure it was to see
Jerry Denny, Billy Nash, Jimmy Collins and others
covering ground, making beautiful stops of what looked
like sure base hits and throwing the ball on line to the
first baseman.

In ’*88 Mike Tiernan batted after Johnny Ward, who
was a great base runner and used a lot of judgment. If
he reached first with none out and saw the third base-
man playing very deep he would signal Mike that
he was going to second. Tiernan was a good hitter and
made some of the longest hits on record. He also could

17

bunt the ball and beat it out, for he was a very fast run-
ner. When Johnny went to second Mike would hit a
slow one to the third baseman, and on the throw to first
Ward would go to third, and very often both of them
were safe. Even if the third. baseman ran in on the
ball and got Mike out first, it was a sacrifice hit and
another would score a run, for Ward was very fast. But
they did not work this play very long, for the old fel-
lows knew all the tricks of the game and soon put a stop
to it. When the American and National. Leagues came
together they thought it would be a great thing
to bunt the ball so the infield could not make a
double play. The. batter might run it out and get a
base hit, and another base hit would score the runner
on second base. So they finally reached a point where
they deliberately put themselves out to advance a runner
to second base, where he was left a good many more
times than he scored. A club that plays that kind of
baseball from the beginning of the game will never
reach the first division. The batter that makes a sacri-
fice hit where another may score a run is accomplishing
something, but the other fellow is too glad to get away
from the plate and has no ambiton unless his manager
instructs him to do it. There are a lot of those kind in
the game to-day. That is why a third baseman has to
play in close. I think an active little man with plenty
of grit to get in front of all hard-hit balls would make
a good third baseman, as he can get down better than
the big fellow when he runs in. But if the pitchers keep
trying to save their arm by pitching low curve balls under
the shoulder, it is only a matter of time when the third —
baseman will have to.go back and play deep. That kind
of pitching was knocked out of the game in ’82 or ’83, so
my advice to pitchers is, keep your arm as high as you
can when throwing low curved balls over the plate, as it
18

has been the uy. successful curve pitching that has
lasted.

Little men who are active and good throwers would
make good outfhelders as they can start quick and cover
a lot of ground, they can recover themselves quicker
than the big fellows on short fly balls and can stoop bet-
ter without falling and prevent the runner from going
to another base.

They can stop short and not run with the ball after
catching it; they can run in on ground balls and get
them better as they are natural infielders and can throw
the ball just as far and as accurately.

They would back up the bases as they are active and
some little men are just as good hitters and base run-
ners; they can slide and get up quick and would get
their base often on balls as they are harder to pitch to.

‘Little men will have to learn to be long, accurate
throwers and hit the ball and run the bases fast and play
the outfield as they want all big men in the infield now.

If the batter would stand in the rear end of the box
with his right foot against the line near the plate and
face the pitcher with more than half of his chest and
both eyes with his left foot out straight near the line at
the plate and have a firm grip on the bat and let it rest
on his shoulder; he then would have a full view of the 7
base line from the home plate to third base.

By standing up in the box sideways he cannot see that
line and with his-side to the pitcher he has to turn his
head to see him with both eyes and that puts a strain
on the lens of the eyes, and if he would face the pitcher

. 3 he would not hit so many of those good line hits foul

-as he would have the base line to guide him and could
_ gauge the ball when pitched accordingly.

The weight of the bat would not-be on his wrists; he
| could | see al curve balls better and would not be fooled
19

so often on low drop balls below the knees which he
ought to let go by.

The catcher would have to get back out of the way of
the bat and the umpire would have a better view of the
plate and see all curve balls better and would make less
mistakes on strikes. 3

The batter would not have to swing so hard at the ball;
he could meet it and line it out with his arms if he
wanted to drive it out straight and hard or hit it in
right field, take a step forward as the ball goes over the
plate and try to hit iton-a line.

If the pitcher has great speed and ts successful throw-
ing straight speedy balls over the plate it is because the
batter is swinging hard at the ball and the pitcher has
the advantage, but if the batter stands erect and tries to
meet the ball with his arms he has a better chance to
hit it in the middle and the old bat will ring. They are
great balls to hit and go off the bat like a shot. ©

A batter at practice should try to hit all balls over
the plate in any part of the diamond he wants to and
should be able to do it before he becomes a major league
player.

A batter should never pull his left foot back or left
handed batter his right foot unless he wants to hit a
ball-on the in-corner of the plate and they are great
balls to hit 1f not too close or too high and can hit them
good and hard at the third baseman or in left field

If you keep pulling your left foot back and can’t get
control of it go out to the ground some morning and have
some one to throw to you; make him put the ball over
the plate as often as he can; stand perfectly still with
your feet and try to hit every one over out straight
towards second base with your arms; let all the close
ones go by and try to hit them on a line; after you have
hit quite a lot try a short step forward and meet the ball

20 :

with your arms and each one goes over the plate take
a step and hit it hard and on a line out straight and you
will soon get your stride again.

A -batter should always keep track of his left foot
when at the plate and step forward before he hits the
ball. . |

A young player should always wait until he has a
strike called on him as the pitcher may be trying to work.
him and he can see the course the ball takes if it is
pitched over the plate he is prepared to hit the next ball
for he is collected and will not be so anxious or easily |
fooled. em

A batter should go to the plate with the intention of
showing the pitcher that he is his boss and the only way
he can do that is not to let him fool him but make him put
the ball over the plate.

The batter can do that if he stands in the position at
the plate that I have advised for he will see the ball
better and. he will not be hit by the pitcher so often for
he can stoop quicker and step away better.

If there are none out and a runner on first base and
three balls and one strike on the batter, it is a good time
for the hit-and run if the ball is thrown over the plate
and all pitchers will try to put it over; it can be hit or
placed by the batter the runner will have a good start
and may take advantage of the catcher and may go to
third if the batter makes a base hit; if the batter lets the
ball go by it will be two strikes and three balls, the
pitcher may fool the batter and strike him out if the
runner is held on first by the pitcher as the catcher knows
he is going to run to second there may be a double play
made or the batter may hit at a bad ball and not be able
to place it as well.

When a runner is on first base he ought to make a
start for second base to see who will cover the bag on
21

the throw from the catcher and stop quick and go back
before he is thrown out so the batter will know in what
direction to hit the ball or place it.

A base runner when on first base should get a good
lead to make the pitcher think he is going to steal second
base just lead enough so he can get back to the base
and not be thrown out by the pitcher; he has got to be
alert and watch the pitcher and make him throw the
ball to try to catch him; if he has to slide let him get up
quick as the ball may be thrown bad and only go a short
distance from first base and far enough for him to get
second base for the first baseman has-to get it and turn
around at times to throw the ball to the man cover-
ing the bag; be quick to take advantage when you see
it; always keep your eyes on the ball when running bases.

The pitcher generally throws the ball low to the first
baseman so he can touch the runner quick when he
slides, that is why he sometimes makes a bad throw.

The runner should always try to worry the pitcher
and make him throw the ball to first base and it may
help the batter as he may waste a few thinking the run-
ner is going to start for second.

He should wait until the batter has a strike called on

him as the pitcher may try to work him and get himself
in bad.
If not watch the pitcher close and see which way he
draws his arm when he throws the ball to the batter and
when he throws to first and when you are sure he is
going to throw to the batter that is the time for you to
go and you don’t need a big lead when you get a good
start for the pitcher may think he has you scared;
never let him worry you; let him do the worrying.

When a runner is on second base and when the pitcher
throws the ball to the batter the runner should always
run far enough to get a good lead to get in on a base

22 :

hit and stop quick if the ball is not hit so he can get back
to second; he should run on the outside so he will have
a straight run home along the base line.

A runner should never try to steal third base when
none out as the batter may make a hit or a sacrifice hit to-
wards the second baseman or first baseman as the both
of them will be playing deep if he trys to make a hit
and it goes to the third baseman or shortstop the runner
can make third on the throw to first if he starts when
the ball is thrown and there is always a chance of the
first baseman making a bad throw if the ball is thrown
to the left of him and the man going to first should not
slide then but keep on the inside of the base line to be
in his way.

Never run until the ball is thrown as the fielder may

make a bluff to throw it. ,
_ Ina close game and one out the runner if fast should
always try to steal third base as he can get a big lead
on the pitcher for he is right in front of him and it is
not a hard base to steal if he has a good lead.

He then could score on a fly to the outfield or a slow
hit to the infield if he had a lead when the pitcher de-
livered the ball to the batter.

When a runner is on second base and two out and
there are no strikes or one strike and three balls on the
batter in a close game and a run will tie the score he
should try to steal third base as he can get a good lead
for the pitcher and catcher’s mind are on the batter.

And if the batter gets his base and runs to second the
catcher will and should throw to second to catch him
and may make a bad throw; there is always a chance of
that and the run will score ‘or the runner if he saw the
ball was there ahead of him if he watched the man who
took the throw could stop quick and go back; so the
man on third if he took a lead when the pitcher deliv-

23

ered the ball to the batter could score if ib is a short
throw to catch the man on third going home then he
would get second; the coacher can make the man on
third go back; a base hit will then score two runs as the
man on second always has a good lead when there are
two out, whereas if the runner had not stolen third it
would orily score one run.

When a base runner is on second base he choniid watch
the fielder when a long fly is hit and he can see if he
will catch it he should get back and stand on the bag and
when the ball hits his hands go for third when there are
none out or one out as it is a long throw and he has to
throw it fast and accurate to catch him and if he muffs
it the ball will roll some distance and he can score on it.

Before the batter touches first base he ought to watch
the coacher in case of a wild throw so he can keep his
stride and can turn quick to go to second.

. He also should stop quick after he touches first base in ~
case the first baseman drops the ball and it may roll away
from him and he should watch the man who takes the
throw at second and-know when to slide-and get up
quick in case of a bad throw by the first baseman who
may have to turn before he throws it. :

The runner should always slide feet first and on the
left side so he will not hurt his throwing arm, throw the
feet in the air and come down on your hip; let your
left arm go out and drag it after you; don’t come down
on your hand as you may hurt your wrist; keep on the
line stealing and slide straight for the bag and the base-
man will not get in your way when you slide at him,
making the fallaway slide on the outside or in front of
the base gives the man that takes the throw plenty of
time and room to touch the base runner and he is not
afraid of the runner spiking him and keeping on the line
the runner has less ground to cover.

When a player is learning to slide he ought to wear
those sliding pads and when he has it down fine he
should never wear them as they are a big load to be
carrying all through the game, especially when they get
wet from sweat they will be very heavy and a player will
not hurt. himself when he knows how to slide he can
sew a piece of oil silk on his pants and that will keep-
the skin from chafing on his hips and he will feel a
great deal more comfortable and lighter and can stoop
for ground balls better and will run faster.

In a game with none out and a runner on third base
the infield should play for the batter and not come in on
the grass for he cannot cover any ground on a hard hit
ball to either side of him but should play back of the
line so he can cover some ground as the runner on third
will not take a chance of being thrown out on a ball hit
to the infield when he knows he can get in if the next
batter hits a fly to the outfield or makes a base hit.

Tf one out the infield can play in the same position n
the runner on third is not fast and the ball hit hard he
can be thrown out at the plate, and if the runner is fast
on third play in short.

If one out and a runner on first and another one on
third always play for a double play if the ball is not hit
hard try and get the runner going to second base; never
be afraid to let a club score a run when there is a chance
to make a double play and clear’the bases trying to keep
a club from scoring a run often gives them a chance for
a rally especially if you don’t get the man at the plate
if you are playing in short to get him.

If your club has a lead of a couple of runs and a man
on third and none out or one out always play deep for
the batter at any stage of the game.

A runner on first base and a ball hit in right field or
center field along the ground the fielder should run in

on it and close his legs on it and keep the man on first
from going to third if hit to one side of him and the
runner goes to third and the fielder thinks he can get

him he should brace himself and throw the ball good and -

hard on a line, not on a bound. 7
dhe shortstop should back up the throw and if the
third baseman, who ought to keep his eyes on the run-
ner, can see easy if he can get him, 1f not he can throw
the ball to the second base and get the man that hit the

ball if he leaves first on the throw to third.

If one or none out when a runner is on second base

and the batter makes a base hit one a fielder can run in
on he should throw it on a line to the plate and if he
don’t get the runner at the plate it will entice the man
who hit the ball to go to second base on the throw home
and the catcher can tell if he keeps his eyes on the
manner. if he can get him at the plate, if not ue can get
the man that hit the ball if he goes to second on the
throw home every time if he don’t delay but throw it as
soon as he catches it and the bases will be empty.
- If a runner is on third base and another on first and
none out the catcher should throw the ball to get the
runner going to second; the pitcher should throw to
first to keep the runner close to the bag and not let him
get a lead; the man on third will not be so foolish to
run home when he knows he has two more chances by
the batter hitting a fly to the outfield or making a base
hit.

If the runner stops before he reaches. oe base
when he knows he is caught he should be run back quick

towards first, the second baseman should not be afraid ~

of the man on third going when he did not go on the
long throw so let him get his speed before the base
runner and touch him quick before he gets his stride.

throw to get the runner at second base if a fast man is
on third and a runner on first starts for second the man
on third will surely start for home on a long throw if
the catcher makes a short throw and a run would tie
the score the coacher would hold the man on third for —
he knows the runner on first will reach second base safe
on a short throw and a fly ball to the outfield will score
him or a slow sacrifice hit for he is fast and a base hit
will score two runs and may win the gamie, so the only
chance is to walk the next batter and trust to make a
double play for if the infield play in short they can’t
cover any ground on either side of them on a hard hit
ball and the runner on third is. fast.

So if the catcher made the short throw it would put
them in a very tight place where if he made the long
throw and got the runner going to second base the run
would only tie the score = the bases would be empty
and two out.

If one out or none out nd the ‘bases are full in the
ninth inning and the score is tied the infield should not
come in on the grass but play on the base line so
they can cover some ground; they should remember
that the man on third is forced out atthe plate and
the catcher don’t have to touch him and if the ball ts
hit hard the catcher, if he stands on the plate may get
the batter at first, making a double play; the pitcher
should throw the ball to third base if the runner takes

any kind of a lead, and make him stay near the base.

If the home club is at bat, the outfield should play
way in so they can throw the runner out at the plate
if they catch a line hit or a short fly; if they play out —
the man on third will score on a fly and win the game.

The club that will be near the top at the end of the
season have got to hit the ball, run the bases; and the
outfield will have to cover ground-on_all base hits and

The club that plays scientific baseball by bunting and
playing for one run all through the game is not playing
major league baseball; it may do well for a while when
the other club is not ‘hitting in an odd game but it is.
bad baseball to play all season as it interferes with the
batter when he is hitting the ball good and “hard to
have to bunt it, for he very often gets out of his stride
at the plate and it keeps the runner from trying to
steal a base when he knows the batter is trying to
advance him; it takes all the ginger out of the game
and also out of the player.

There was some changes made in the playing rules
such as; catching a foul tip and none out; or one out
and throwing. it to the base and making a double play
before the runner on a base could get back to it; and
dropping a fly ball in the infield; or trapping it when
runners were on first and second base with none out
or one out, making a double play.

And a runner on third and one out or none out
an outfielder, if a long fly was hit, would tap it up in
the air before catching it to keep the runner on the
base until the ball was caught; or if he went as soon as
the ball hit the fielder’s hands he would have to go back
and touch the base again; and the ball would be fielded
quick to third base and the runner was often held there
especially by long accurate throwers.

Also fouling the ball if the batter had the pitcher in
a hole; if the pitcher threw it over the plate, the batter
would hit it foul until the pitcher threw a bad one and
he got his base on balls. |

So to keep him from doing it, if he hit the first ball
he struck at and hit it foul, it is a strike; or if he hits
the next one foul it is a strike; but he can hit as many

as he likes after that, unless he bunts it, but the batters
don’t seem to take advantage of it when they have the
pitcher in a hole.

The rule looks so ridiculous; they did not wait until
the batter had the pitcher in a hole and then if he
fouled the ball call it a strike, but if he fouled the first
ball pitched it is a strike; and to give a pitcher credit
for striking a batter out if he hits the ball in the middle
of it and lines it foul, just because he -hits quick and
has got his eye on it; and it may be the second strike,
as some good hitters will wait for a strike to be called
on them, especially if there are men on the bases; or
he may hit one away out near the foul line, and if it
is caught then it is a foul fly, if not a strike; and if the
umpire makes a mistake and calls him out on the third
strike, or he misses the ball by a small margin, the
pitcher gets credit for striking him out.

If the batter makes a foul tip, or a foul hits the
wire behind the catcher, or goes into the stand near
the wire, or over the stand, the batter almost missed the
ball and the pitcher should get credit for a strike; but -
not when the batter hits the ball in the middle of it
and the pitcher is not in a hole, as the pitcher don’t fool
him; and there should be some discretion made by
painting lines on the stand, and the ball would have to
go on the inside of them to be a strike; and not be
robbing the batter of what belongs to him; it is a
foul ball and should not be anything else.

And it disgraces the batter to give a pitcher credit for
what he does not accomplish; and have such a nonsen- —
sical rule in the national game.

I will put the young fellow wise to a few things
they have to do to be successful.

The principal thing he has to do is take good care of
his eyes. -ITo do that he must not read much at night,

especially lying down; if he goes to a moving picture
show, let him not sit too close to the pictures. Sleep
is a great rest for the eyes and for the ball player.
Keep the bowels well regulated; that is the main thing.

He should also take good care of his throwing arm. :

in hot water and put it around his shoulder and elbow

knee joints and ankles a couple of times a week, it will
help to make him fast.

Every morning when he gets up, before breakfast,
if he would place his feet almost together and bend down
and almost touch the floor about fifty times good and
quick, and after breakfast, take a walk, he would always
feel supple and not get that tired and lazy feeling, which
all ball players have at times, and. interferes with
their playing. |

Drinking a lot of stuff in the morning and at- dinner,
no matter what it is, will bring on that feeling quicker
than anything else. If a player feels thirsty, let him —
eat some fruit. It will make the blood rich, and help
to keep the bowels regular; and he will always .be Z

want their players to have their naraval sleep; and
not be afraid of a fine. And when he gets up, if he
is not feeling good, take a sedlitz powder; and a short
walk then, after dinner, and during the game, he will
feel good and have an eye like a hawk; and the manager
will think more of him when he knows the player ‘was
trying to get himself in condition for the game.

If a player does not get his natural sleep, and reports |
at the ground and takes his practice, he may feel all right,
running around and sweating in the heat of the morning;
but when four o'clock comes he would prefer his bed
than playing baseball, and will have no ginger in him.

Mr. Lane, editor of the Baseball Magazgime, said all
authors should show some facts to verify what they
write about; so here is one about the old Metropolitans
when they won the championship of the American As-
sociation in ’84.

The Columbus and St. Louis Clubs were chasing the
old champs pretty fast the latter part of June, and when
we reached Columbus, Jim Mutrie, who was our man-
ager then and was a whole soul fellow, asked the boys
to refrain from all intoxicants while in Columbus, as
they were a great fielding club and we had to hit the
ball to win; and when we would get back to old New
York, he and John B. Day, who was president of the
Giants and owned the old Metropolitans, and was built ~
like all New Yorkers are, would give the boys a grand
rush a shay affair. |

And the old warriors tried how red lemonade would
work on their system while in Columbus, and they won
the first two games and lost the third and last game
by the score of 6 to O, the first time they were shut out
that season.

The next day was the third of July and was an off —

day, and they rode all. day. And going into See Louis

that_evéening, Big Chief Roseman said to Mutrie Jim,
“The boys have got to temper up to-night; that red
~ lemonade they drank in Columbus has made them all
«feel like strangers to each other.”

~ Jim answered back saying we play in St. Louis in
the morning and afternoon and that the club has’ struck
their gait and there will be one of them big holiday
crowds there and we will have to play ball to win.

“Well Jim,” said the Chief,” “if you think we can
win without drowning that stuff we drank under your
instructions in Columbus, I for one, don’t think so; and
that last game we played don’t prove it.

“Well, wait until to-morrow night and we will all gO
together and get it out of our system,” said Jim.

But nature took its course with the majoritv of the
boys, who were favorites in St. Louis and had a lot
of friends there, and they did not reach the hotel until
the sun was shining.

Jim got wind of it and put a fine of a hundred dollars
apiece on every player who did not show up before
he went to bed himself.

It was a very hot morning and they had the largest
crowd ever attended a morning game—fifteen thousand.
The old champs ran around like colts in the hot sun and
felt like fighting cocks. And the red lemonade and the
old juice poured out of them and they felt like the old
New York boys again. !

Arlie Latham often remarked after: “I will never
forget the determined look that band of Indians had
on their faces that morning.”

McGinnis pitched for St. Louis, and he never in
his existence got such a walloping as the old Metropoli-
tans gave him; winning the game 17 to 0. But in the
afternoon they acted like a lot of dead ones. Dave
Foutz pitched for St. Louis and his drop ball was

working to perfection, and the Metropolitans were ~
nearly all low ball hitters and loved to get up against
such pitchers as Foutz or others that would try to fool
them on low balls.

But Dave got away with it, for the old Indians of
the morning were only lambs, and St. Louis had them
7 to O up to the seventh inning.

Mutrie who was watching the financial end, and was
an up-to-date fellow, saw the trouble with the fleet and
got a bottle of Hennesey’s Three Star and brought it
over to the bench saying, “Take a good high one of
this and get some life in you, for I never saw such a
lot of dead ones. And after this, any player that don’t
get his sleep will get what’s coming to him, and that
goes.”

“Say Jim,” said one of ee fellows that never drank
anything that would go to his head, “I am going to
take a high one off Foutz this time, as he stepped to
pick up his bat, and I am going to meet it. We are
trying to knock that drop ball of his out of the lot but
we are hitting it in the air.”

So he called for a high ball as he went to the plate,
and the first batter up that inning. Dave tried to draw
him on by wasting the high ones and still pitching the
drop ball, but he would not bite at them and got his
base on balls.

Big Chief Roseman, who had a voice like John L.
Sullivan, and was a great coacher, who was after having
one of Mutrie’s high ones, jumped up to the coaching
line and shouted at Foutz, calling him a big pair of scis-
sors, and told him his mother raised him on asparagus.
The next batter called for a high ball and he met one in
the middle and lined it out safely. The next batter also
called for a high ball. You could see Dave twitching and
getting uneasy and at last lost his head and others with

him, and the old champs scored nine runs that inning and
won the game, 14 to 9. When the bunch got into the
coaches they looked around for Mutrie, but he had
scooted around to our old friend, Chris Von der Ahe,
who was a great admirer of the old Metropolitans and
took great delight in seeing the old ball hit good and
hard, and 1f his own club could not do it, he took just as
much pleasure watching the other fellows hit, when
they had a batting streak. So-Jim got him to put a -
half dozen quarts of “Mother’s Milk,” as Bill Devery
christened it, on the ice, and the old Metropolitans
made short work of it and drowned the red lemonade
along with Jim’s hundred dollar fines. |

And that is one Fourth of July that my old friend
Charley Comiskey, who was the manager of the St.
Louis Club at that time, will never forget. He often
mentioned it as the invasion of the Indians.

Some people, after reading this about the old Met-
ropolitans, will think they were a lot of “topers.” They
were not, but nearly all New York boys and, and, as all
big city boys, mix in with all kinds of people, and go in
saloons. They drink’a glass of beer instead of soft
stuff and they did not indulge in it, but mere habit.
And in those days, the public knew all the players and
associated with them, and they understand the game and
could give the ball players an argument on the game.
They did not go to the grounds and shout at the ball
player if he made a bad play, and clap and stamp their
feet to try and rattle the other club’s pitcher. They
were built of the right stuff, and wanted to see the
home club win, but they had to do it without any help
from the audience.

They loved the old game and treated all players alike,
by applauding all good plays made in the game.

And big crowds attended the games then. If a club

was well up in the race, all big cities averaged five or
six thousand to a game; and from ten to fifteen thou-
sand on Saturday, and would pack the grounds on
holidays and root for the home club to win, and had
just as much enthusiasm in them as they have now.

I am going to wind up this old marathon manu-
script by throwing a few bouquets to those who justly
deserve credit for making baseball what it is to-day,
and that is, the newspapers, who gave it so much space,
and. the reporters, who scored the games in a broad-
minded way, which made the ball players cover
ground when they knew they would get. the benefit
of a doubt, which was the best improvement ever put
in the national game, and made all ball players cover
a lot of ground, especially good players, that could get
any thing hit at them, and were stuck on having fine
‘averages; get all the speed they had in them into the
game. Where, in the old days, they would not pull
together, and give the ball player what belonged to him,
and try to improve the game; but stuck to the old method
and gave him an error, no matter how hard he tried

to get the hit, and it helped the players to have good ©

averages both in fielding and batting. The impartial
way they score the game to-day and that is etiquette.
