# Overview

This directory contains source code for the OpenMPF Tika text detection component.

Supports most document formats (.txt, .pptx, .docx, .doc, .pdf, etc.) as input.
Extracts text contained in document and processes text for detected languages
(71 languages currently supported). For PDF and PowerPoint documents, text will
be extracted and processed per page/slide. The first page track (with detection
property PAGE_NUM = 1) corresponds to first page of each document by default.

Users can also enable metadata reporting.
If enabled by setting the job property STORE_METADATA = "true", document 
metadata will be labeled and stored as the first track.
Metadata track will not contain the PAGE_NUM, TEXT, TAGS, or TRIGGER_WORDS detection properties.

All text extracted will also be tagged based on content.
The content tags can be set by user by providing a new context-tag file path
for the TAGGING_FILE job property.


# Text Tagging

All text extracted from an image can also be tagged using regular expression (regex) patterns
specified in a JSON tagging file. By default this file is located in the
`config` folder as `text-tags.json`. 

In the tagging file, users can specify regex patterns using the [Java
regex operators](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html).
Of note, the `\W` non-word operator and `\b` word-break operator may prove
useful. Note that these must be escaped as `\\W` and `\\b` in JSON.

Regex tags in the JSON tagging file can be entered as follows:

```
    "TAGS_BY_REGEX": {
        "vehicle": [
            {"pattern": "auto"},
            {"pattern": "(\\b)bike(\\b)"},
            {"pattern": "(\\b)bus(\\b)", "caseSensitive": true}
        ]
        "next-tag-category" : [
            ...
        ]
    }
```

Where each `"pattern"` specifies the regex used for tagging.
To enable case-sensitive regex tag search, set the `"caseSensitive"` flag to true for each
regex pattern that requires case sensitivity. For example:

```
    {"pattern": "Financial", "caseSensitive": true}
```

Will search for words containing "Financial" with the first letter capitalized.
On the other hand the following patterns:

```
    {"pattern" :"Financial", "caseSensitive": false}
    {"pattern" :"Financial"}
```

Will search for "financial", "Financial", "FINANCIAL", and any other variation
of "financial" in terms of capitalization.

Phrases containing words separated by **zero** or more whitespace and/or
punctuation characters can be represented using `\\W*`. For example, the
`Hello(\\W*)World` regex pattern will match:

* "Hello World"
* "HelloWorld"
* "Hello.World"
* "Hello. &$#World"

Phrases containing words separated by **one** or more whitespace and/or
punctuation characters can be represented using `\\W+`.

For example, the `Hello(\\W+)World` regex pattern will match:

* "Hello World"
* "Hello.World"
* "Hello. &$#World"

But not:

* "HelloWorld"

Adding `(\\b)` to the start or end of a regex pattern will reject any word
characters attached to the start or end of the pattern being searched. For
example, `(\\b)search(\\W+)this(\\W+)phrase(\\b)` will match:

* "search this phrase"
* "search  this, phrase"

But not:

* "research this phrase"
* "search this phrasejunk"

Removing the leading and trailing `(\\b)` will allow these phrases to be matched, excluding the extraneous leading/trailing characters.

To escape and search for special regex characters use double slashes `\\` in front of each special character.
To escape and search for a single backslash in text, users have to specify `\\\\` as the regex pattern.

For example, to search for periods we use `\\.` rather than `.`, so the regex pattern becomes `(\\b)end(\\W+)of(\\W+)a(\\W+)sentence\\.`. Note that the `.` symbol is typically used in regex to match any character, which is why we use `\\.` instead.

The OCR'ed text will be stored in the `TEXT` output property. Each detected tag will be stored in `TAGS`, separated by commas. The substring(s) that triggered each tag will be stored in `TRIGGER_WORDS`. For each trigger word the substring index range relative to the `TEXT` output will be stored in `TRIGGER_WORDS_OFFSET`. Because the same trigger word can be encountered multiple times in the `TEXT` output, the results are organized as follows:

* `TRIGGER_WORDS`: Each distinct trigger word is separated by a semicolon followed by a space. For example: `TRIGGER_WORDS=trigger1; trigger2`
    * Because semicolons can be part of the trigger word itself, those semicolons will be encapsulated in brackets. For example, `detected trigger with a ;` in the OCR'ed `TEXT` is reported as `TRIGGER_WORDS=detected trigger with a [;]; some other trigger`.
* `TRIGGER_WORDS_OFFSET`: Each group of indexes, referring to the same trigger word reported in sequence, is separated by a semicolon followed by a space. Indexes within a single group are separated by commas.
    * Example `TRIGGER_WORDS=trigger1; trigger2`, `TRIGGER_WORDS_OFFSET=0-5, 6-10; 12-15`, means that `trigger1` occurs twice in the text at the index ranges 0-5 and 6-10, and `trigger2` occurs at index range 12-15.

Note that all `TRIGGER_WORD` results are trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace, regardless of the regex pattern used. The respective `TRIGGER_WORDS_OFFSET` indexes refer to the trimmed substrings.
