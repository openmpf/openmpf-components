# OpenMPF Components

Welcome to the Open Media Processing Framework (OpenMPF) Component Project!

## What is the OpenMPF?

OpenMPF provides a platform to perform content detection and extraction on bulk multimedia, enabling users to analyze, search, and share information through the extraction of objects, keywords, thumbnails, and other contextual data.

OpenMPF enables users to build configurable media processing pipelines, enabling the rapid development and deployment of analytic algorithms and large-scale media processing applications.

### Search and Share

Simplify large-scale media processing and enable the extraction of meaningful content

### Open API

Apply cutting-edge algorithms such as face detection and object classification

### Flexible Architecture

Integrate into your existing environment or use OpenMPF as a standalone application

## Overview

This repository contains source code for Open Media Processing Framework (OpenMPF) components licensed under an Apache 2.0 or compatible license.

Included in this repository are the following C++ Components:
- Caffe Object Classification
- DLIB Face Detection
- OpenCV LBP Face Detection
- OpenALPR Text Detection

And the following Java Components:
- Sphinx Speech Detection

## Getting Started

### Building the C++ Components

- In order to build the C++ components you must first install the [OpenMPF C++ Component SDK](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-cpp-component-sdk).
- cd into the `openmpf-components/cpp` directory.
- Run the following commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake3 ..
make install
```

- The built plugin packages will be created in: `openmpf-components/cpp/build/plugin-packages`.

**Building Individual C++ Components**

If you would like to only build a single component, you can cd into that component's directory and run the build commands listed above.

### Building the Java Components

- In order to build the Java components you must first install the [OpenMPF Java Components SDK](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-java-component-sdk)
- cd into the `openmpf-components/java` directory.
- Run `mvn package`.
- The built plugin packages will be in each components' `target/plugin-packages` directory.

**Building Individual Java Components**

If you would like to only build a single component, you can cd into that component's directory and run `mvn package`.

### Installing and Registering a Component

Once a component is built, follow the [Installing and Registering a Component](https://openmpf.github.io/docs/site/Packaging-and-Registering-a-Component/#installing-and-registering-a-component) instructions to utilize the component in OpenMPF
