# OpenMPF Components

Welcome to the Open Media Processing Framework (OpenMPF) Component Project!

## What is OpenMPF?

OpenMPF performs content detection and extraction (such as face detection, text extraction, and object classification) on bulk image, video, and audio files, enabling content analysis and search through the extraction of objects, keywords, thumbnails, and other contextual information.

This scalable, web-friendly platform enables users to build configurable multimedia processing pipelines, enabling the rapid development and deployment of analytic algorithms and large-scale media processing applications.
